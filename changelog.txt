Version 0.3.2
Patch Fixes:
- fixed rare occurrence where revealing the second debris field in the first step of the "Finding The Luminary" mission failed due to "curr" being null. This happened if you saved after starting the mission, then loaded before having fully interacted with the first debris field. If you run into this issue, the workaround is to find the second debris field manually (the first debris field is very big, the second is very small).
- fixed one instance of blurb text for one of the vanilla underworld mission replacements never actually firing, showing the default vanilla text instead
- added forum link to version checker file

Version 0.3.1
Patch Fixes:
- player could pay their co-conspirators and go into debt doing so
- player could not actually get a reward from "complaining" to Remy
- pirate complication in Drop mission always hailed player and was not set as important
- intel screen getMapLocation didn't actually point the player where they needed to go during the payment phase of the Luminary quest
- deciding to keep The Luminary resulted in -100 vengeful rep with the quest giver, changed to `EXTREME` penalty (less than you think)
- keeping the Luminary also failed to trigger any other consequences
- two instances of receive being misspelt
- add minor stage setting during a certain situation when leaving via shuttle
