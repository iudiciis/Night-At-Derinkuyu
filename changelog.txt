Version 0.3.1
Patch Fixes:
- player could pay their co-conspirators and go into debt doing so
- player could not actually get a reward from "complaining" to Remy
- pirate complication in Drop mission always hailed player and was not set as important
- intel screen getMapLocation didn't actually point the player where they needed to go during the payment phase of the Luminary quest
- deciding to keep The Luminary resulted in -100 vengeful rep with the quest giver, changed to `EXTREME` penalty (less than you think)
- keeping the Luminary also failed to trigger any other consequences
- two instances of receive being misspelt
- add minor stage setting during situation when leaving via shuttle with 'guilt'

Version 0.3.0
First version on the forums. (hopefully)
- Dialogue rewrite of the first bar mission, "The Derinkuyu Drop"
- All (intended) dialogue for the unlocked Independent Underworld contact completed
- New mission, "Finding The Luminary", where you can get an early Apogee if you want to

Version 0.1.0b
First version of the mod!
- Adds a single, short bar mission
- Adds an Independent Underworld contact with (mostly) custom dialogue for vanilla missions
