With practiced precision, your technicians and engineers crack open the shielded crate without tripping any alarms or hidden security measures. It doesn't take long to discover a custom-built miniaturized stealth relay, folded neatly and waiting to conduct any number of nefarious schemes upon its enemies.

""Hey, watch it!"" You hear your chief engineer suddenly bark over comms, overeager machinery powering down in the background. ""The crate was one thing, this is another.

""Could've sworn... no, it's fine work, but not military.
