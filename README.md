# Night At Derinkuyu
This is a mod for the video game [Starsector](http://fractalsoftworks.com).

## About this mod
Intended to be a story-oriented mod focusing on the relatively unimportant Derinkuyu Mining Station, this mod currently adds two vaguely related short missions and an Independent Underworld contact with partially custom dialogue for vanilla missions to the campaign.
